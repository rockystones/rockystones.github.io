If you need to measure something from a bunch of images, and the processing method is repetitive for each one, don't you want to do it automatically in seconds rather than clicking buttons all day?

## The power of coding and automation

Whatever you can achieve in ImageJ by clicking buttons, you can do it automatically using ImageJ Macros.  

It is always better if your images file names fits regular expressions. Then you can do a lot more.

Some parts of the processing may still need to be manual because you don't have a good plugin/code package to use. For example, some thresholding or segmentation may be too hard for the ImageJ build-in functions.

ImageJ can interface with MATLAB/Java/Python etc, so if you can find a package that can achieve the goal written in other languages, then you can design a new multi-stage processing pipeline, exporting and importing data between different stages of processing.  

## How to start with ImageJ Macro coding

Start with [Macro recording](https://imagej.net/ij/developer/macro/macros.html#recorder), get familiar with what function you are actualy calling when clicking buttons. 

Then learn more about the [syntax of Macro language](https://imagej.net/ij/developer/macro/macros.html).
How to use loops, operators, statements, functions, and debugging. 

There are a lot of [macro examples](https://imagej.net/ij/macros/) for you to learn the syntax from. 

There are already a lot of build-in functions, but you can write your own functions within script, or make it more permanent by defining it in the Library.

Macro is not the best coding language to work with, it has its kinks. But ImageJ will be a lot more powerful using the Macro language. 

## Examples of how I use ImageJ macro

Batch processing to do simple conversion(format, color, etc), measurements.
