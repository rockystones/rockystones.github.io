To decide whether you want to publish a certain dataset or not, it is simple as this: Do you still have more plans for this dataset?
Do you think other people might benefit from your dataset?

Of course you should keep it close if you still have more analysis to be done on the dataset. But if not, your data might greatly benefit other researchers who are in dire need for some high quality data. 

Compared to the trouble you went through to collect, analyze, publish your data, the effort to put them on a public archive is negligible.
