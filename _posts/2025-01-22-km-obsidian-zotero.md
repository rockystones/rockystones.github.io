Getting a PhD means you are generating new knowledge for humankind. But human knowledge accumulated over centuries are too much for a single mind to fully comprehend. It's like swimming/boating in an endless ocean, you can't really make a good progress without proper navigation methods. 

Zotero is free and open source. It's perfect for literature management and even website clipping. I like it a lot more than Endnote. 

Obsidian is free and popular. It features local storage and interlink between notes. 

The combination of the two can be magical.

More to add from reading the Medium.
